# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App

This project is a full-stack machine learning web application that predicts the price of a house based on inputs like area (in sqft), number of BHKs, bathrooms, and location. The application combines a **Flask API** for backend logic and a **React.js frontend** for user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### 🔧 Backend (ML + API)
- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle (for model serialization)

### 💻 Frontend (Web Interface)
- React.js
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Axios (for API calls)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

---

## 📌 Features

- User inputs:
  - Area (in square feet)
  - Number of BHKs
  - Number of Bathrooms
  - Location (from dropdown)
- Predicts house price instantly
- Clean and responsive UI
- Integrated with a trained machine learning model
- Logo and background image support for better design
- Input validations and error handling

Would you like me to:

- Create and upload this file for you?
- Include a license file (`MIT` or `Apache`)?
- Add deployment links if you're using Vercel/Render?

Let me know and I can assist step by step.
